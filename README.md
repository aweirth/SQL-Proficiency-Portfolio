### This folder contains my undergraduate coursework and projects using PostgreSQL. Queries are organized into individual markdown files grouped by the following topics:

* **Database Project**: data engineering project establishing a relational database for 200 years of summer and winter olympics data. Queries covered importing data, cleaning, establishing primary and foreign keys, and querying the data to visualize medal distributions based on economic factors.

* Using **GROUP BY** and **JOINS**.

* Working with timezones and creating pivot tables with the **CROSSTAB** function.

* Working with the **POSTGIS** extension and spatial data.

* Using regular expressions and working with text; also working with **TSVECTOR** types and utilizing **TSQUERY**.
